DeepLight's objective is to enable Screen-Camera Communication in real-world conditions where the camera is hand-held, and the modulation must be imperceptible at COMMON display rates (30-60FPS). Under these conditions, the state-of-the-art is susceptible to screen extraction error (losing part of the screen or including the content close to the screen) as the decoder explicitly split the extracted screen into a grid. Consequently, a slight deviation from the original grid may result in a large percentage of a cell being translated into neighboring cells and vice versa. In addition, the state-of-the-art relies on high frame rates (>=120FPS) to suppress the flickers created by the modulation, which is less common in public spaces. DeepLight is robust against screen extraction error as it does not explicitly split the extracted screen into a grid. Instead, it decodes each bit using the information of the entire screen via a convolutional neural network. Thank to the holistic decoding approach, DeepLight is sufficiently robust to support high decoding accuracy even with a hand-held camera (with hand-motion artifacts). Of course, DeepLight still needs to localize and extract the screen from camera frames with reasonably high accuracy. DeepLight applies a deep-learning-based, pixel-wise segmentation method to localize the screen. It then uses a RANSAC-like algorithm with contour analysis to detect the border of the screen with a practically high IOU of 89% in indoor environments. Finally, DeepLight achieves a significantly higher Mean Opinion Score (MOS) compared with the state-of-the-art by selectively encoding the data in only the Blue channel (primate eyes are known to be less sensitive to Blue color due to lower number of receptors). 

In this project, we implement DeepLight in both offline (using python) and real-time (using Objective-C for iPhone) modes. For the offline mode, we use Keras and Tensorflow to implement the neural network. For the real-time mode, we port the code into Objective-C and C++. We use the CoreML framework to execute the neural networks and use the OpenCV framework for typical image processing tasks.

## Code structure

OFFLINE MODE: stable/python
Download the weights files for LightNet and ScreenNet at the following URL, and put the files in "weights" folder:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pkz3prKmwAsPRFtsS6NHyeCVZXAQV4c2?usp=sharing

Download the test files at the following URL, and put the files in "test" folder:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kmif3tUZfqG5S2NNanDKHsHADN__pjS1?usp=sharing

Run the following command to test:
python deeplight.py -v test/fixed_alice.avi -ltn weights/LightNet.h5 -scn weights/ScreenNet.json -t 4 -d log -o 0 -n -1
-v: input video
-ltn: weight file for LightNet
-scn: weight file for ScreenNet
-t: screen detection interval (run ScreenNet intermittently)
-d: log file name
-o: output type: 1 - print decoded text; 0 - record binary data in log.txt. The extracted screens are always recorded in log.avi
-n: number of frame to run (provide -1 to run all frames in the input video). 

REAL-TIME & OFFLINE MOBILE MODE: stable/ios
Download the OpenCV framework at the following URL, and place it in the project folder (in the same folder with main.m):

Download the weight files (in CoreML) format for LightNet and ScreenNet at the following URL, and put them in "Models" folder in the Xcode project:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W1UFW-pOHX1KfN7ZTjEzCdCzvLP2vx34?usp=sharing

To run the code in an iPhone using a pre-recorded video, download the test videos at the following URL, and drag the file to the OLDeepLight App (on the iPhone) using the file sharing Tab in Finder (on MacOS):

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kmif3tUZfqG5S2NNanDKHsHADN__pjS1?usp=sharing

Press "Next" button to run 100 frames and displays the decoded text in the debug terminal

The other buttons are used to start and stop the continuous running mode to measure power consumption only.
